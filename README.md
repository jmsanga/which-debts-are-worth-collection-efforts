# which-debts-are-worth-collection-efforts
This notebook explores the effectiveness of a bank's collection strategy.

I use regression discontinuity to see which debts are worth collecting and provides information whereas it makes financial sense or not.

I look at a situation where a bank assigned customers to different recovery strategies based on the expected amount the bank believed it would recover from the customer. My goal is to determine in this non-random assignment whether the incremental amount the bank earns exceeded the additional cost of assigning customers to a higher recovery strategy.

I chose this project because threshold assignments like this also one occur in medicine (above a certain temperature you get medicine), education (above a certain test score students get admitted to a special class), other areas of finance (above a certain wealth customers get different levels of service), and public sector (below a certain income someone is eligible for housing benefits). Regression discontinuity is an intuitive and useful analysis method in any situation of a threshold assignment.
